# Intro

This project was built using react so it gives me a little practice with react forms as well - something I didn't know fully. The requirements from [The Odin Project Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library#assignment) can be found here.

## The JS Stuff
A file called functions.js in the src folder should have everything pertaining to the course

## React stuff
I can't say I enjoyed this one. Maybe I underestimated my knowledge of React, so it took me longer than I hoped. But it's here nonetheless.
