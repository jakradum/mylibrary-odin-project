# Intro

This project was built using react so it gives me a little practice with react forms as well - something I didn't know fully. The requirements from [The Odin Project Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library#assignment) can be found here.

## The JS Stuff
A file called odin_project prototype.js in the src folder should have everything pertaining to the course

The assignment required us to create an object prototype with 3 functions - add book, change status of read/unread, and delete book. All 3 of them are handled via javascript and not just through React UI. 

## React stuff
The React UI is meant to reflect the properties of the underlying JavaScript object. `addBook`, `deleteBook` etc are JS functions on the prototype along with React states that manage the UI changes.
